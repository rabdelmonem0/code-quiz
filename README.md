# code-quiz
This assignemnt was by the far the most difficult for me. I defintaly need more practice ccreating elements dynamically. I can't seem to get my timer to stop at 0 and end the quiz. Also my final page will not show up when the quiz is finished before the time runs out. I made sure to lay out all my script code in the same order as my HTML. I know I have the right idea I am just not fully understanding the concepts and need to spend more time on this assignment. I am continuing to work on it with my tutor ALexa Stef.
